# dr-mansi
This project is a personal website for Dr. Mansi Thanvi, a BHMS-qualified Homeopathy Practitioner. The website is designed to act as both a blog/testimonial space and a professional portfolio where new patients can learn about her holistic healing approach and contact her directly for consultations.
